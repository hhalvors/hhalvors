# Abstract

I review two accounts of global reference frames in
spacetime theories (and Einstein's special theory of relativity in
particular):

1. Absolutism: All fundamental facts are frame-independent, and the
   frame-relative facts are derivable from them.
   
2. Fragmentalism: All fundamental facts are frame-relative, and there
   are no non-trivial logical relations between the facts in one
   reference frame and the facts in another reference frame.

I argue that both of these accounts are fatally flawed, and I develop
an alternative account that builds on the intuitions behind these
other accounts. (I also consider the relation between these accounts
and methodological imperatives regarding "good physics".) Finally I
consider whether this sharpened account of contextualism in relativity
theory can shed light on the sort of contextualism that we encounter
in quantum theories.


# Can a realist be a perspectivalist? 

- **Scientific realism** is typically factored into two components:
  - Semantic: One is to interpret the statements of the theory literally 
  - Epistemic: One is to believe all of the statements of the theory 
	  
- There is a hidden third component: how is a theory supposed to be
related to its user?
  - The "no user needed" account is the default in contexts where the
    theory is formulated in enough detail that its interpretation is
    unambigous 
  - The "two level" account: a theory can be like a black box, so long
	as a user can employ it to arrive at true beliefs "in context"
	

# The Big Question

- Many traditional realists would assume that **ineliminable
  perspectivalism** is inconsistent with scientific realism
  
  - Ineliminable perspectivalism: the perspective-bound facts cannot
    be derived from absolute facts 

- Question: Can a scientific theory be "good enough" if it is
ineliminably perspectival, i.e.\ if it fails to provide a core of
absolute truths?

picture 

  - Is "find a coordinate free formulation" an epistemic imperative?
  
  - Is "find a gauge free fromulation" an epistemic imperative? 



# Coordinates and reference frames 



- How should we think of computing *invariants*?


  
# STR as test case

- Relativism
  - Jozef Petzold
  - Kit Fine: fragmentalism

- Absolutism
  - Hermann Minkowski
  - Four dimensionalism (Balashov)
  - Geometric constructivism (Janssen, Norton)
  

# Review of STR



# Frame-dependent and Frame-independent Facts 






# Fragmentalism

- Kit Fine (2005) proposes that each reference frame gives a
  "fragment" of Reality
  - The **facts** in two fragments are incompatible with each other 
  - Compare with Rovelli's "Neither presentism nor eternalism": change
    is real, but it is local. (Some presentists would simply say:
    Rovelli's change is not objective.)


# The flaw of fragmentalism

(Hofweber and Lange)

- HH: Fragmentalism simply fails to mention that there *are*
  non-trivial relations between facts in the different fragments
  - How are we to understand these relations?
  - A simple proposal: the two observers are talking about the same
    facts. But there is no "third person" to state these facts in a
    frame-independent fashion
	

# Covariance

- Saying that the velocity is $v$ in $F$ is **compatible** with saying
  that the velocity in $v'$ in $F'$

- In fact, there is a **rule** that takes facts in $F$ to facts in
  $F'$

	
	
	
	
	
# Contextualism versus Perspectivalism 

- Example(s): perspective in everyday life 
  - shapes appear differently to people standing in different places
  - colors appear differently to people to people relative to
    different background lighting conditions

- Example: three-dimensional shape projected onto two-dimensional
  surfaces
  
- Example: centering features 


- Does Minkowski spacetime give a "view from nowhere"?
  - Should STR serve as a template for future physical theories?
  
- Sider's criterion for equivalence of descriptions



	


# Unremarkable contextualism

- Compare with Gil Harman




# Quantum mechanics

- Summary: Most "realist" interpretations of QM seem to have no need
  for talk about contextualism -- which might be seen as a form of
  observer relativity
  
  - Where is the contextualism in GRW? 
  
  - There is one way of reading Grete Hermann and Niels Bohr as saying
    that QM is an intrinsically contextual theory: it is a function
    from classical measurement contexts to descriptions 
	
	
# Quantum mechanics 

- The hidden variables theorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker) seem to show
  that any such variables must be contextual
  - However, every interpretation wants to explain the appearance that
    an arbitrary observable $A$ does possess a value when it is
    measured
  - E.g. Bohmian mechanical explanation of spin values: spin-$a$
    becomes correlated with position, and in that case, we say that
    spin-$a$ has the value for the branch in which the particle
    configuration is located


# Quantum mechanics


- **Basis perspectivalism:** For each maximal subset $C$ of compatible
  events, the quantum state $\rho$ gives a classical probability
  distribution $\rho |_C$ over $C$.
  
  $$ \rho (A) = \int \omega (A)d\mu (\omega ) $$

- The probability distribution in one context $C$ does not uniquely
  determine the probability distribution in another context $C'$.
	
- The distribution $\rho |_{C}$ is compatible with the distribution
  $\rho |_{C'}$. But the states $\omega$ are bound to the context $C$,
  and meaning nothing outside of it.
  
  


# Contextualism in quantum mechanics 

- Non-contextual interpretations of QM? 
  - Everett: observers who are confined to branches only see aspects
    of reality. However, the theorist has a God's eye view of the
    universal wavefunction, and that is just how things are
  - Bohm: Particles have an absolute configuration




# Questions

- Given a contextual theory $T$, shouldn't there be a non-contextual
  theory $T'$ from which $T$ can be derived?
