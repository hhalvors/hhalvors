  <h1 class="page-title">Niels Bohr: Philosopher in Action</h1>
     <p>Niels Bohr wasn’t a philosopher by trade, but he was an exemplar of a
professional scientist who engaged in philosophical reflection and
debate at a high level. Bohr’s work in physics was driven by
philosophical vision; and what he discovered in physics fed back into
his philosophical worldview. For example, Bohr frequently spoke of
“the epistemological lesson of quantum physics”. Whether or not we
agree with Bohr about what the philosophical lessons of quantum
physics are,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> we should admire his attempt to bring his worldview
into harmony with the deliverances of science. In short, Bohr had a
“pro-science attitude” and a philosophy of life that supported that
attitude.</p>
<p>While we wish to understand what Bohr’s “philosophy” was, it has not
proven helpful to try to put Bohr into the classificatory boxes that
analytic philosophers have created. For example, it’s hardly
interesting to ask whether Bohr was a “realist” or “antirealist” if
philosophers cannot make up their mind about what those words
mean.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="why-bohr-and-why-now">Why Bohr and why now?</h2>
<p>Niels Bohr thought hard about the foundations of quantum theory for
fifty years. He traded ideas with the greatest minds of the times,
often dealing with severe criticism. Nonetheless, these days,
discussions of the foundations of quantum theory often begin with
dismissive phrases such as “we won’t consider the Copenhagen
interpretation”.</p>
<p>Let’s set aside the fact that the “Copenhagen interpretation”, as it
emerged after World War II, is hardly what Niels Bohr was pushing
for.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Why should we <em>not</em> consider the view of one of the main
players in the development of quantum physics — and, admittedly, the
most philosophically reflective of those players? Could we please have
a hint about the basic mistake or misconception in Bohr’s point of
view? Where does he go wrong? Adding some citations, to substantiate
the attribution of a view to Bohr, would just be icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, we were trained to think that it takes some work to
figure out what the good ideas are. We were also trained to read
charitably, paying attention to context and linguistic
subtleties. Bohr has not received much of this kind of careful reading
in recent years, so it seems that somebody ought to do it.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Bohr also opined on some of the biggest questions in philosophy —
e.g. free will, the aims of science, etc. Surely it could be
interesting to learn what he thought about such topics.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>Q: Did Bohr think that the wavefunction collapses upon measurement?</p>
<p>Bohr never says that the wavefunction collapses upon
measurement. However, he does say that the very notion of a system’s
<em>state</em> makes sense only in the idealization where the system is not
under active observation. [add citation!]</p>
<p>Q: Did Bohr think that the world is split into two parts — a quantum
part and a classical part.</p>
<p>No, not really. Or more accurately: no, not ontologically. Bohr says
explicitly that the entire world is quantum, including the measuring
devices we use to probe the quantum world. Nonetheless, Bohr says that
the goal of physics is to produce objective descriptions, and that
such descriptions ultimately bottom out in the words of everyday
language such as “here” or “there”.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Many contemporary philosophers look to physics primarily for
<em>ontological</em> lessons, i.e. lessons about what exists and how it
moves. The assumption seems to be that questions about our
epistemological situation are of secondary importance, or ought to
be answered by the complete theory of the physical world. It’s an
old philosophical dilemma: should we first produce a theory of
what there is and then figure out what we’re capable of knowing,
or should we first figure out what we’re capable of knowing and
then produce a theory of what there is?<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>By some standards, Bohr was clearly a scientific realist. For
example, he says that the existence of atoms and their parts has
clearly been demonstrated. By other standards, Bohr was clearly a
an antirealist. For example, he says that it’s impossible to
achieve a God’s eye view of reality. (Bernard Williams indicates
in a few places that if you don’t believe that science can provide
the “absolute conception”, then you’re not a realist.)<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>All credit to the pioneers who tried to make sense of Bohr’s
ideas long before it was cool to do so: Don Howard, Henry Folse,
and Jan Faye, among a few others. Credit also to those who have
contributed new insights in recent years: Scott Tanona, Kristian
Camilleri, Guido Bacciagaluppi, and Michael Cuffaro, among a few
others.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
