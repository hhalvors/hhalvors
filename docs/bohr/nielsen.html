  <h1 class="page-title">Rasmus Nielsen</h1>
     <p>During his lifetime, Rasmus Nielsen (1809-1884) was the most famous
philosopher in Denmark and Norway. Unfortunately for Nielsen’s
philosophical legacy, he was an overtly Theistic philosopher at
precisely the moment that Denmark and Norway were growing out of the
conservative Christian mould. In short, Nielsen was the last
philosopher in Scandinavia who put God in the center of his
philosophical system. The next generation wanted a philosophy without
God, or at least without God playing such a central role, and so they
essentially stopped interacting with Nielsen’s philosophy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But Nielsen did influence many people — despite an apparent lack of
self-awareness of the existence of this influence. At least that is
our hypothesis. Nielsen influenced Harald Høffding in a direct way;
and there is good reason to think that Nielsen influenced Christian
Bohr (who was a student in his <em>Filosofikum</em> course). In fact, Nielsen
was in many ways responsible for the intellectual climate in Denmark
in the second half of the 1800s, and as such, Nielsen is a key figure
for understanding Niels Bohr’s relationship to the preceding
philosophical tradition. (Nielsen was also more of a transitional
figure to secularization than was recognized by those who took him to
be its enemy.)</p>
<p>It is well-established that Bohr read some Kierkegaard. Nonetheless,
we agree with other scholars that Bohr wouldn’t have nodded his head
and said, “yes, I agree with Kierkegaard.” The problem is that
Kierkegaard’s worldview was too different from Bohr’s — too focused
on the God-human relationship, sin, redemption, etc. And Kierkegaard
doesn’t seem to say anything of relevant to the practice of
science. So, it would seem misguided to look for a direct influence of
Kierkegaard on Bohr.</p>
<p>That leaves open the question of whether there might have been an
indirect influence of Kierkegaard on Bohr. Could Kierkegaard have
influenced a mindset that Bohr himself inherited? Recall that Bohr was
a student at the University of Copenhagen fifty years after
Kierkegaard died. What were the philosophical trends in Copenhagen
when Bohr was a student? It certainly wasn’t trendy to be a Hegelian,
as it was at Cambridge, as Hegel’s philosophy had never really found a
receptive audience in Denmark. There might have been some hints of
neo-Kantianism, which was popular at that time in neighboring
Germany. But there was no neo-Kantian professor at the University of
Copenhagen.</p>
<p>In short, none of the “major” philosophical traditions
(i.e. traditions that one reads about at American universities) was
ascendant in Denmark when Niels Bohr was a student. Not British
empiricism, nor continental rationalism, nor their Kantian synthesis,
nor the Hegelian resolution of Kantian subjectivity. As of 1905,
philosophy in Denmark <em>was</em> Harald Høffding, and Høffding was
eclectic.</p>
<p>Despite his eclecticism, there is no doubt that Høffding was
profoundly influenced by his reading of Kierkegaard.</p>
<h2 id="nielsen-and-kierkegaard">Nielsen and Kierkegaard</h2>
<p>In the 1830s, Hegelianism was in the air at the University of
Copenhagen. The newly appointed professor of theology, Hans Lassen
Martensen, was a right-wing Hegelian. It’s not surprising then, that a
young student like Rasmus Nielsen would follow suit, and his earliest
work was explicitly Hegelian.</p>
<p>Nielsen was a student at the same time as Søren Kierkegaard. We know
from Kierkegaard’s journal entries that they were acquaintances. But
Kierkegaard dawdled, and then used his rather large inheritance to
support his writing career. In contrast, Nielsen was appointed
professor of philosophy at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The big mystery about Rasmus Nielsen is why his conversion to
Kierkegaard’s philosophy led him to undertake a diligent study of the
natural sciences and their methods. One might have expected the
opposite — i.e. one might have expected that Nielsen’s admiration
for Kierkegaard would have led him further away from the sciences.</p>
<p>(Nielsen’s later works include detailed discussion of recent advances
in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. Nielsen
introduced Darwin’s theory of evolution to Denmark, and he argued that
it is perfectly compatible with traditional Christian doctrines.)
Nielsen was, in an important sense, the first philosopher of science
in European history.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-darwin">Introducing Darwin</h2>

<h2 id="no-gods-eye-view-for-humans">No god’s eye view for humans</h2>
<h2 id="the-faith-reason-controversy">The faith-reason controversy</h2>
<p>Many people associate Kierkegaard’s name with the phrase “leap of
faith”, and they naturally assume that Kierkegaard advocated blind
faith, both in God and in Christian doctrine. Even in university
classrooms, Kierkegaard is frequently used as an example of a
“fideist”, i.e. a person who holds that religious truth is beyond the
reach of human reason.</p>
<p>The true story about Kierkegaard is, of course, much more
complicated. To a zeroeth approximation, Kierkegaard was a critic of
“Reason”. But Kierkegaard was in a context, and in that context,
“Reason” was G.F.W. Hegel’s “Wissen” and “Wissenschaft”. If you know
anything about Hegel, you know that his notion of “Wissen” is a far
cry from the pedestrian notion of believing things on the basis of
sufficient evidence. The point is that we need to be cautious about
putting Kierkegaard in a box that simply doesn’t make sense for his
context.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Nielsen — unlike Kierkegaard — was inspired
by the natural sciences. He believed that science (<em>Videnskab</em>) is an
essential part of the task of human life, and that it delivers great
goods to human kind.</p>
<p>Nielsen had been working up to it for many years, and in his book
<em>Grundideernes Logik</em> (1864), he states it directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith and reason are different kinds of things.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see from his lecture notes, Nielsen had long been preaching
this lesson to his students. However, the publication of the overt
statement was the occasion for a backlash, and most notably by Georg
Brandes who wrote the pamphlet <em>Dualisme i vores nyeste Philosophie</em>
(1866). (Brandes, born in 1842, had just completed his degree at the
University of Copenhagen.) In this pamphlet, Brandes attacks Nielsen’s
conception of the relation between faith and reason, arguing that it
is as psychological impossibility to have a faith that is uninformed
by considerations of a rational nature.</p>
<h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not clear how much medieval philosophy Rasmus Nielsen
knew. Nonetheless, there are incredibly strong parallels between
Rasmus Nielsen’s views on faith and reason and the medieval
doctrine of two truths (Averroes, Boetius of Dacia, Siger of
Brabant). The doctrine of two truths says essentially that a
proposition might be true from the point of view of science but
false from the point of view of faith.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be too much of a stretch to think that Rasmus Nielsen’s
views on faith and reason had any direct influence on Niels Bohr
— certainly not on the question of faith and reason, and not even
on Bohr’s idea of “complementary” viewpoints. (Bohr is very
tolerant about religion, and sees value in it, but he definitely
rejects its claims upon him.) Nonetheless, it is perhaps culturally
telling that both of these Danes thought of reality as
“fragmented”, or more accurately, as requiring fragmented points of
view.</p></li>
<li><p>There is much work still to be done in figuring out what Rasmus
Nielsen’s views and arguments were — and teasing out the good
ideas, if there are any. (It’s another task, of course, to try to
tease out the ways in which Nielsen influenced subsequent Danish
thinkers, and perhaps indirectly, other thinkers outside of
Denmark.) Besides his many published works (all in Danish), Nielsen
left handwritten notes that have been preserved by the Royal
Library of Denmark. The library also maintains notes written by his
students, e.g. Harald Høffding.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>There are some short expressions of admiration in the literature
— after all, Nielsen had been their teacher. But there is only
one place, to our knowledge, where there is explicit engagement
with Nielsen’s philosophy: in Høffding’s book <em>Danske Filosoffer</em>.
Here Høffding argues that Nielsen’s entire philosophy simply
doesn’t work. Of course, Høffding reduces Nielsen’s philosophy to
a single point (which, to be fair, was Nielsen’s main point):
knowledge is possible only if God exists.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
