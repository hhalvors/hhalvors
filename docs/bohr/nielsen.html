  <h1 class="page-title">Rasmus Nielsen</h1>
     <p>During his lifetime, Rasmus Nielsen (1809-1884) was the most renowned
philosopher in the Scandinavian countries. Unfortunately for his
philosophical legacy, he was an explicitly Christian philosopher —
most interersted the old question of faith vs. reason — at the time
that the Scandinavian countries were moving at a breakneck pace in the
direction of secularization. In short, the next generation of
Scandinavian thinkers thought they had no use for Nielsen’s
philosophy, and so it has been almost completely forgotten. (Not a
single one of Nielsen’s philosophical works has been translated into
English.)</p>
<p>We think, however, that Nielsen had much more of an enduring influence
than the subsequent generation realized. In fact, we believe that
Rasmus Nielsen is <em>the</em> key figure for understanding Niels Bohr’s
relationship to the preceding philosophical tradition — from
Descartes through Kant and on to Kierkegaard, etc.. It would have been
difficult, in many ways, for Bohr to have been directly influenced by
Kierkegaard. After all, Kierkegaard basically expressed distaste for
the natural sciences — or to contrast with what we said earlier
about Bohr, Kierkegaard did not have a pro-science attitude. But
Rasmus Nielsen was interestingly different. In fact, the big mystery
about Rasmus Nielsen is how his admiration of Kierkegaard led him to
undertake a diligent study of the natural sciences and their
methods. (Nielsen’s later works include detailed discussion of recent
advances in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and
psychology. Nielsen introduced Darwin’s theory of evolution to
Denmark, and he argued that it is perfectly compatible with
traditional Christian doctrines.) Nielsen was, in an important sense,
the first philosopher of science in European history.</p>

<h2 id="the-faith-reason-controversy">The faith-reason controversy</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, Nielsen — unlike Kierkegaard — was inspired
by the natural sciences. He believed that science (<em>Videnskab</em>) is an
essential part of the task of human life, and that it delivers great
goods to human kind.</p>
<p>Nielsen had been working up to it for many years, and in his book
<em>Grundideernes Logik</em> (1864), he states it directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith and reason are different kinds of things.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see from his lecture notes, Nielsen had been preaching this
lesson to his students for many years hence. However, the publication
of the overt statement seems to have occasioned a backlash by young
intellectuals, and most notably by Georg Brandes who wrote the
pamphlet <em>Dualisme i vores nyeste Philosophie</em> (1866). In this
pamphlet, Brandes argues that Nielsen’s conception of the relation
between faith and reason does not mesh with human psychology.</p>
<h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2>
<p>There is much work still to be done in figuring out what Rasmus
Nielsen’s views and arguments were — and evaluating whether there
are any good ideas in there. Besides his many published works (all in
Danish), Nielsen left handwritten notes that have been preserved by
the Royal Library of Denmark. The library also maintains notes written
by his students, e.g. Harald Høffding.</p>
