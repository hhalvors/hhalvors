     <p>Question: Did Niels Bohr ever cite any philosopher in a positive way?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, there was one. Poul Martin Møller</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Poul Martin Møller (1794-1838) is remembered primarily for the people
he influenced: Søren Kierkegaard (his student) and Niels Bohr (via
Bohr’s reading of Møller’s <em>En Dansk Students Eventyr</em>).</p>
<p>Møller’s early life was typical for the “gentry” in early 19th century
Denmark. He was the son of a parish pastor, went to a fancy high
school (gymnasium), and studied theology at the University of
Copenhagen. But on the personal side, his life was a bit tumultuous,
with at least one very serious infatuation that didn’t lead
anywhere. After getting his university degree, Møller became a ship
chaplain, and while onboard he translated works of ancient Greek
literature into Danish.</p>
<p>Later Møller got a post teaching philosophy at the university in
Kristiania (now Oslo). Recall that Norway had only received
independence in 1814 and at that point of time, the languages of
Denmark and Norway were essentially the same. Or to be more accurate,
there were many spoken dialects in Norway but the written language
(bokmål) was essentially Danish.</p>
<p>While in Kristiania, Møller seems to have had a Hegelian period. But
it was short lived. When he was offered a job at the University of
Copenhagen in 1832, he returned to join in with Frederik Christian
Sibbern’s rejection of Hegel. Recall also that Søren Kierkegaard had
begun his studies in 1830, and Møller was to become one of his primary
influences. (Møller’s residence in Copenhagen was on Nytorv, just
across from the Kierkegaard residence on Gammeltorv.)</p>
<h2 id="works">Works</h2>
<p>Møller didn’t publish much in the way of academic philosophy. One
notable exception is his article about the possibility of life after
death <span class="citation" data-cites="jensen2022poul">(Jensen and Stewart 2022)</span>. He also left behind some lecture notes and
some aphorisms that have been collected in various places, including
the book <em>Strøtanker</em>.</p>
<p>Møller also wrote poetry and novellas, most notably <em>En Dansk Students
Eventyr</em> — a book that contains quite a bit of philosophy.</p>
