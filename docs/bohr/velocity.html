  <h1 class="page-title">Velocity</h1>
     <p>An alternate title for this note is “the concept of momentum”,
suggesting that it’s an unpartisan inquiry into the genealogy and
prospects of this concept. In case you were thinking “who cares about
momentum?” the answer is “all of physics from at least the late middle
ages until today”. In short, the canonical presentation of a physical
theory takes two variables to be basic: position and momentum.</p>
<p>We should, however, come clean that our motivation is somewhat
partisan. Niels Bohr urged physicists not to surrender the powerful
tool for reasoning that is encapsulated in the principle of the
conservation of momentum. Insofar as he would have been willing to
throw around the world “real”, Bohr would have insisted that momentum
is real. What were his reasons for saying this, and should we listen
to him? (And, ultimately, what difference does it make?)</p>
<p>In more simple, but technical, terms: Bohr’s interpretation of quantum
mechanics would have different quantities being definite in different
contexts. There are some contexts in which position is definite, and
other contexts in which momentum is definite. In contrast, Bohmian
mechanics demands that position is always definite — and that
momentum, if we are to talk about it at all, is a derivative
concept. Did Bohr give good reasons, then, to think that the Bohmian
picture misses out on important features of reality?<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-velocity-could-not-be">What velocity could (not) be</h2>
<p>Either velocity is fundamental, or it is not (see <span class="citation" data-cites="arntzenius2000 lange2005can">(Arntzenius 2000; Lange 2005)</span>). And isn’t it pretty obvious that velocity is not
fundamental? After all, and supposing that physical objects have
followed continuous trajectories, can we not simply define <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = <em>d</em><em>x</em>/<em>d</em><em>t</em></span>?
In short, velocity is simply a summary of which positions an object
has occupied over time.</p>
<p>No, the view that velocity is <em>defined</em> to be change of place over
time mistakenly assumes that it makes sense to talk about being in the
same place at two different times. Setting aside deep metaphysical
questions (which seem never to get settled), no theory in modern
physics assumes a primitive notion of identity between different
places at different times. To see this clearly, consider the case of
“Galilean spacetime”, which is all the spacetime structure we need to
do Newtonian particle mechanics <span class="citation" data-cites="weatherall2021cl">(see Weatherall 2021)</span>: Galilean
spacetime is assumed to be composed of an infinite number of copies of
a three-dimensional Euclidean space <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, indexed by a time parameter
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em> ∈ ℝ</span>. Most importantly, there is no sense to be made of
writing “<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span>”, where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is a point in <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is a point in
<span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>t</em>′</sub></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> ≠ <em>t</em>′</span>. Since Galilean spacetime “washes out” the
identity of points at different times, there is no sense in which an
object can be at the same (or at a different) place at different
times.</p>
<p>Thus, in post-Galilean physics, velocity cannot be defined as change
of position with respect to time. Does it follow that velocity is
fundamental? We cannot answer affirmatively until we consider the
question of what velocity is supposed to be: a property of an object,
or a relation between objects.</p>
