<h1 class="title">Niels Bohr on Causality</h1>

</header>
<p>The following is a fairly comprehensive set of citations — from the
four-volume <a
href="https://philosophia.dk/?product=niels-bohrs-samlede-filosofiske-skrifter-4-bind">philosophical
writings</a> — where Bohr discusses causality (or conservation laws). We
omit detailed commentary, which can be found in the corresponding
article “Niels Bohr on the Causal Ideal”.</p>
<p>As for page numbers, we use the original articles, which are
collected in <a

Bohr Collected Works</em></a>.</p>

<p>In particular, for impacts in which the time of collision is short
compared to the natural periods of the atom and for which very simple
results are to be expected according to the usual mechanical ideas, the
postulate of stationary states would seem to be irreconcilable with any
description of the collision in space and time based on the accepted
ideas of atomic structure. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1925atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1925atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1925</a> p 848)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>That such a procedure actually leads to a self-contained theory
sufficiently analogous to classical mechanics depends essentially on the
fact that, as Born and Jordan were able to show, there exists in
Heisenberg’s quantum mechanics a conservation theorem analogous to the
energy law of classical mechanics. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1925atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1925atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1925</a> p 852)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Notwithstandig the difficulties which hence are involved in the
formulation of the quantum theory, it seems, as we shall see, that its
essence may be expressed in the so-called qnantum postulate, which to
any atomic process attributes an essential discontinuity or rather
individuality, completely foreign to the classical theories and
symbolised by Planck’s quantum of action. This postulate implies a
renunciation as regards the causal space-time co-ordination of atomic
processes. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1928qp" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p
566)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>On the other hand, if in order to make observation possible we permit
certain interactions with suitable means of measurement, not belonging
to the system, an unambiguous definition of its state is naturally no
longer possible, and there can be no question of causality in the
ordinary sense of the word. The very nature of the quantum theory thus
forces us to regard the space-time co-ordination and the claim of
causality, the union of which characterises the classical theories, as
complementary biit exclusive features of the description, syniholising
the idealisation of observation and definition respectively. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a href="#ref-bohr1928qp"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p 567)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Just as the relativity theory has tgught us that the convenience of
sharply distinguishing between space and time solely rests on the
smallness of the velocities ordinarily met with compared to the velocity
of light, we learn from the quantum theory that the appropriateness of
our usual causal space-time description depends entirely upon the small
value of the quantum of action as compared to the actions involved in
ordinary sense perceptions. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a href="#ref-bohr1928qp"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p 567)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Nevertheless the conservation of energy and momentum during the
interaction between radiation and matter, as evident in the
photoelectric and Compton effect, finds its adequate expression just in
the light quantum idea put forward by Einstein. As is well known, the
doubts regarding the validity of the superposition principle on one hand
and of the conservation laws on the other, which were suggested by this
apparent contradiction, have been definitely disproved through direct
experiments. This situation would seem clearly to indicate the
impossibility of a causal space-time description of the light phenomena.
On one hand, in attempting to trace the laws of the time-spatial
propagation of light we are according to the quantum postulate confined
to statistical considerations. On the other hand, the fulfilment of the
claim of causality for the individual light processes characterized by
the quantum of action entails a renunciation as regards the space time
description. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1928qp" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p
567-568)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In the language of the relativity theory the content of the relations
(2) may be summarized in the statement that according to the quantum
theory a general reciprocal relation exists between the maximum
sharpness of definition of the space-time and energy-momentum vectors
associated with the individuals. This circumstance may be regarded as a
simple symbolical expression for the complementary nature of the
space-time description and the claims of causality. At the same time,
however, the general character of this relation makes it possible to a
certain extent to reconcile the conservation laws with the space-time
co-ordination of observations, the idea of a coincidence of well-defined
events in space-time points being replaced by that of unnharply defined
individuals within finite space-time regions. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a href="#ref-bohr1928qp"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p 571)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Here this postulate does indeed represent the idea of the
individuality of the particles which, transcending the space-time
description, meets the claim of causality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a href="#ref-bohr1928qp"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p 572)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Moreover the conception of a stationary state involves, strictly
speaking, the exclusion of all interactions with individuals not
belonging to the system. The fact that such a closed system is
associated with a particular energy value, may be considered as an
immediate expression for the claim of causality contained in the theorem
of conservation of energy. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a href="#ref-bohr1928qp"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p 582)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Thus we see that no causal connection can be obtained between
observations leading to the fixation of a stationary state and earlier
observations on the behaviour of the separate particles in the atom.
<span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1928qp" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p
587)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In both cases we are concerned with a demand of causality
complementary to the space-time description, the adequate application of
which is limited only by the restricted possibilities of definition and
observation. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1928qp">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1928qp" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1928</a> p
587)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In particular, any attempt at an ordering in space-time leads to a
break in the causal chain, since such an attempt is boundup with
anessential exchangeof momentum and energy between the individuals and
the measuring rods and clocks used for observation; and just this
exchange cannot be taken into account if the measuring instruments are
to fulfil their purpose. Conversely, any conclusion, based in an
unambiguous manner upon the strict conservation of energy and momentum,
with regard to the dynamical behaviour of the individual units obviously
necessitates a complete renunciation of following their course in space
and time. In general, we may say that the suitableness of the causal
space-time mode of description for the ordering of our usual experiences
depends only upon the smallness of the quantum of action relative to the
actions with which we are concerned in ordinary phenomena. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934quant">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934quant" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934b</a> p

<hr />
<p>It might still be permitted here briefly to refer to the relation
which exists between the regularities in the domain of psychology and
the problem of the causality of physical phenomena. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934quant">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934quant" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934b</a> p
100)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>we have learned, by the discovery of the quantum of action, that a
detailed causal tracing of atomic processes is impossible and that any
attempt to acquire a knowledge of such processes involves a funda-
mentally uncontrollable interference with their course. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934quant">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934quant" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934b</a> p
100)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>This principle symbolizes, as it were, the peculiar reciprocal
symmetry relation between the space-time description and the laws of the
conservation of energy and momentum, the great fruitfulness of which,
already in classical physics, depends upon the fact that one may
extensively apply them without following the course of the phenomena in
space and time. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934quant">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934quant" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934b</a> p
94)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>any conclusion, based in an unambiguous manner upon the strict
conservation of energy and momentum, with regard to the dynamical
behaviour of the individual units obviously necessitates a complete
renunciation of following their course in space and time. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934quant">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934quant" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934b</a> p
98)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Indeed, only by a conscious resignation of our usual demands for
visualization and causality was it possible to make Planck’s discovery
fruitful in explaining the properties of the elements on the basis of
our knowledge of the building stones of atoms. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1934atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p 108)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>the continuous, causal description is replaced by a fundamentally
statistical mode of description. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1934atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p 110)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>any determination of the energy and the momentum of the particles
demands that we renounce their exact co-ordination in time and space. In
both cases, the invocation of classical ideas, necessitated by the very
nature of measurement, is, beforehand, tantamount to a renunciation of a
strictly causal description. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1934atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p 114)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>The resignation as regards visualization and causality, to which we
are thus forced in our description of atomic phenomena, might well be
regarded as a frustration of the hopes which formed the starting-point
of the atomic conceptions. Nevertheless, from the present standpoint of
the atomic theory, we must consider this very renunciation as an
essential advance in our understanding. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a href="#ref-bohr1934atomic"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p 115)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>any observation necessitates an interference with the course of the
phenomena, which is of such a nature that it deprives us of the
foundation underlying the causal mode of description. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934atomic" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p

<hr />
<p>Planck’s discovery has led us to recognize that the adequacy of our
whole customary attitude, which is characterized by the demand for
causality, depends solely upon the smallness of the quantum of action in
comparison with the actions with which we are concerned in ordinary
phenomena. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934atomic" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p
116)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Just as the freedom of the will is an experiential category of our
psychic life, causality may be considered as a mode of perception by
which we reduce our sense impressions to order. At the same time,
however, we are concerned in both cases with idealizations whose natural
limitations are open to investigation and which depend upon one another
in the sense that the feeling of volition and the demand for causality
are equally indispensable elements in the relation between subject and
object which forms the core of the problem of knowledge. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934atomic">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1934atomic" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1934a</a> p
116-117)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>A causal description in the classical sense is possible only in such
cases where the action involved is large compared with the quantum of
action, and where, therefore, a subdivision of the phenomena is possible
without disturbing them essentially. If this condition is not fulfilled,
we cannot disregard the interaction between the measuring instruments
and the object under investigation, and we must especially take into
consideration that the various measurements required for a complete
mechanical description may only be made with mutually exclusive
experimental arrangements. <span class="citation"

role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1933</a> p 422)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Any question of a return to a mode of description consistent with the
principle of causality was, however, …excluded by unambiguous experience
of the most varied kind. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bohr1938biology">(<a href="#ref-bohr1938biology"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1938a</a> p 74)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>The view-point of ‘complementarity’ does, indeed, in no way mean an
arbitrary renunciation as regards the analysis of atomic phenomena, but
is on the contrary the expression of a rational synthesis of the wealth
of experience in this field, which exceeds the limits to which the
application of the concept of causality is naturally confined. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1938biology">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1938biology" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1938a</a> p
75)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Indeed, the impossibility in psychical experience to distinguish
between the phenomena themselves and their conscious perception clearly
demands a renunciation of a simple causal description on the model of
classical physics, and the very way in which words like ‘thoughts’ and
‘feelings’ are used to describe such experience reminds one most
suggestively of the complementarity encountered in atomic physics. <span
class="citation" data-cites="bohr1938biology">(<a
href="#ref-bohr1938biology" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1938a</a> p
78)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>How radical a change in our attitude towards the description of
nature this development of atomic physics has brought about is perhaps
most clearly illustrated by the fact that even the principle of
causality, so far considered as the unquestioned foundation for all
interpretation of natural phenomena, has proved too narrow a frame to
embrace the peculiar regularities governing individual atomic processes.
Certainly everyone will understand that physicists have needed very
cogent reasons to renounce the ideal of causality itself; but in the
study of atomic phenomena we have repeatedly been taught that questions
which were believed to have received long ago their final answers had
most unexpected surprises in store for us. <span class="citation"
data-cites="natural1939">(<a href="#ref-natural1939"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1939a</a> p 88)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>On the contrary, we have to do with a rational development of our
means of classifying and comprehending new ex- perience which, due to
its very character, finds no place within the frame of causal
description that is only suited to account for the behaviour of objects
as long as this behaviour is independent of the means of observation.
Far from containing any mysticism contrary to the spirit of science, the
view-point of "complementarity" forms indeed a consistent generalization
of the ideal of causality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="natural1939">(<a href="#ref-natural1939"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1939a</a> p 90)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>The question at issue has been whether the renunciation of a causal
mode of description of atomic processes involved in the endeavours to
cope with the situation should be regarded as a temporary departure from
ideals to be ultimately revived or whether we are faced with an
irrevocable step towards obtaining the proper harmony between analysis
and synthesis of physical phenomena. <span class="citation"
data-cites="einstein1949">(<a href="#ref-einstein1949"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1949</a> p 202)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Yet, a certain difference in attitude and outlook remained, since,
with his mastery for co-ordinating apparently contrasting experience
without abandoning continuity and causality, Einstein was perhaps more
reluctant to renounce such ideals than someone for whom renunciation in
this respect appeared to be the only way open to proceed with the
immediate task of co-ordinating the multifarious evidence regarding
atomic phenomena, which accumulated from day to day in the exploration
of this new field of knowledge. <span class="citation"
data-cites="einstein1949">(<a href="#ref-einstein1949"
role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1949</a> p 206)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Thus, a sentence like “we cannot know both the momentum and the
position of an atomic object” raises at once questions as to the
physical reality of two such attributes of the object, which can be
answered only by referring to the conditions for the unambiguous use of
space-time concepts, on the one hand, and dynamical conservation laws,
on the other hand. While the combination of these concepts into a single
picture of a causal chain of events is the essence of classical
mechanics, room for regularities beyond the grasp of such a description
is just afforded by the circumstance that the study of the complementary
phenomena demands mutually exclusive experimental arrangements. <span

role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1949</a> p 211)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>The trend of the whole argumentation presented in the Como lecture
was to show that the viewpoint of complementarity may be regarded as a
rational generalization of the very ideal of causality. <span
class="citation" data-cites="einstein1949">(<a href="#ref-einstein1949"

<hr />
<p>Both in relativity and in quantum theory we are concerned with new
aspects of scientific analysis and synthesis and, in this connection, it
is interesting to note that, even in the great epoch of critical
philosophy in the former century, there was only question to what extent
a priori arguments could be given for the adequacy of space-time
co-ordination and causal connection of experience, but never question of
rational generalizations or inherent limitations of such categories of
human thinking. <span class="citation" data-cites="einstein1949">(<a
href="#ref-einstein1949" role="doc-biblioref">Bohr 1949</a> p

<hr />
<p>This phenomenon afforded, as is well known, a most direct proof of
the adequacy of Einstein’s view regarding the transfer of energy and
momentum in radiative processes; at the same time, it was equally clear
that no simple picture of a corpuscular collision could offer an
exhaustive description of the phenomenon. Under the impact of such
difficulties, doubts were for a time entertained even regarding the
conservation of energy and momentum in the individual radiation
processesj a view, however, which very soon had to be abandoned in face

<p>As regards the quantum-mechanical description, we have to deal here
with a two-body system consisting of the diaphragm as well as of the
particle, and it is just with an explicit application of conservation
laws to such a system that we are concerned in the Compton effect where,
for instance, the observation of the recoil of the electron by means of
a cloud chamber allows us to predict in what direction the scattered
photon will eventually be observed. <span class="citation"

<p>In Newtonian mechanics, where the state of a system of material
bodies is defined by their instantaneous positions and velocities, it
proved possible, by the well-known simple principles, to derive, solely
from the knowledge of the state of the system at a given time and of the
forces acting upon the bodies, the state of the system at any other
time. A description of this kind, which evidently represents an ideal
form of causal relationships, expressed by the notion of determinism,
was found to have still wider scope. <span class="citation"

<p>Although, of course, the classical description of the experimental
arrangement and the irreversibility of the recordings concerning the
atomic objects ensure a sequence of cause and effect conforming with
elementary demands of causality, the irrevocable abandonment of the
ideal of determinism finds striking expression in the complementary
relationship governing the unambiguous use of the fundamental concepts
on whose unrestricted combination the classical physical description
rests. <span class="citation" data-cites="qphil1958">(<a

<p>Above all the explanation of the orbital motion of the planets in our
solar system, based on simple mechanical principles and the law of
universal gravitation, deeply influenced the general philosophical
attitude in the following centuries and strengthened the view that space

categories for the comprehension of all knowledge. <span

<p>New fundamental aspects of the observational problem, entailing a
revision of the very foundation for the analysis of phenomena in terms
of cause and effect, were to be uncovered by the development initiated
by Planck’s discovery of the universal quantum of action in the first
year of this century. This discovery proved that the wide applicability
of so-called classical physics rests entirely on the circumstance that
the action involved in any phenomena on the ordinary scale is so large
that the quantum can be completely neglected. In atomic processes,
however, we meet with regularities of a novel kind, defying causal
pictorial description but nevertheless responsible for the peculiar
stability of atomic systems on which all properties of matter ultimately
depend. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr61unity">(<a

<hr />
<p>The description of ordinary experience presupposes the unrestricted
divisibility of the course of the phenomena in space and time and the
linking of all steps in an unbroken chain in terms of cause and effect.
Ultimately, this viewpoint rests on the fineness of our senses which for
perception demands an interaction with the objects under investigation
so small that in ordinary circumstances it is without appreciable
influence on the course of events. In the edifice of classical physics,
this situation finds its idealized expression in the assumption that the
interaction between the object and the tools of observation can be
neglected or, at any rate, compensated for. <span class="citation"

<p>A crucial point, irrevocably excluding the possibility of reverting
to causal pictorial description, was the recognition that the scope of
unambiguous application of the general conservation laws of momentum and
energy is inherently limited by the circumstance that any experimental
arrangement, allowing the location of atomic objects in space and time,
implies a transfer, uncontrollable in principle, of momentum and energy
to the fixed scales and regulated clocks indispensable for the
definition of the reference frame. <span class="citation"

<p>Ellis’ demonstration of the continuous spectral distribution of the
electrons directly emitted from the nucleus raised a puzzling question
about energy conservation, which was eventually answered by Pauli’s bold
hypothesis of the simultaneous emission of a neutrino, affording the
basis for Fermi’s ingenious theory of <span

<p>Notwithstanding the radical departure from deterministic pictorial
description, with which we are here concerned, basic features of
customary ideas of causality are upheld in the correspondence approach
by referring the competing individual processes to a simple
superposition of wave functions defined within a common
space-time-extension. <span class="citation"

<hr />
<p>Evidence on the spins of the nuclei involved in the process seemed
contradictory to the conservation of angular momentum. It was, in fact,
to evade such difficulties that Pauli introduced the bold idea, which
should be most fruitful for the later development, that a very
penetrating radiation, consisting of particles with vanishing rest mass
and spin one-half, the so-called neutrinos, were emitted in <span
class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-decay together with the electrons.

<hr />
<p>The essential indeterminacy in question must therefore not be taken
to imply a one-sided departure from the ideal of causality underlying
any account of natural phenomena. The use of energy conservation in
connexion with the idea of stationary states, for instance, means an
upholding of causality particularly striking when we realise that the
very idea of motion, on which the classical definition of kinetic energy
rests, has become ambiguous in the field of atomic constitution. <span

<p>As I have stressed by the argumentation mentioned, space time
co-ordination and dynamical conservation laws may be considered as
<em>two complementary aspects of ordinary causality</em> which in this
field exclude one another to a certain extent, although neither of them
has lost its intrinsic validity. <span class="citation"

<hr />
<p>Still, just as the account of those aspects of atomic constitution
essential for the explanation of the ordinary physical and chemical
properties of matter implies a renunciation of the classical ideal of
causality, the features of atomic stability, still deeper-lying,
responsible for the existence and the properties of atomic nuclei, may
force us to renounce the very idea of energy balance. <span

<p>Thus, any attempt to fix the space-time co-ordinates of the
constituent particles of an atom would ultimately involve an essentially
uncontrollable exchange of energy and momentum with the measuring rods
and clocks which prevents an unambiguous correlation of the dynamical
behaviour of the atomic particles before the observation with their
later behaviour. Inversely, every application of conservation theorems,
for instance to the energy balance in atomic reactions, involves an
essential renunciation as regards the pursuance in space and time of the
individual atomic particles. In other words, the use of the idea of
stationary states stands in a mutually exclusive relationship to the
applicability of space-time pictures. <span class="citation"

<p>In fact, such measurements of momentum require only an unambiguous
application of the classical law of conservation of momentum, applied
for instance to a collision process between the diaphragm and some test
body, the momentum of which is suitably con- trolled before and after
the collision. It is true that such a control will essentially depend on
an examination of the space-time course of some process to which the
ideas of classical mechanics can be applied; if, however, all spatial
dimensions and time intervals are taken sufficiently large, this
involves clearly no limitation as regards the accurate control of the
momentum of the test bodies, but only a renunciation as regards the
accuracy of the control of their space-time coordination. <span

<p>By allowing an essentially uncontrollable momentum to pass from the
first particle into the mentioned support, however, we have by this
procedure cut ourselves off from any future possibility of applying the
law of conservation of momentum to the system consisting of the

for an unambiguous application of the idea of momentum in predictions
regarding the behavior of the second particle. <span class="citation"

<p>The recognition of the essential dependence of any physical
phenomenon on the system of reference of the observer, which forms the
characteristic feature of relativity theory, implies, however — as

physical object relative to a given system of coordinates is uniquely
determined, quite independently of whether it is observed or not. <span

<p>Indeed this circumstance presents us with a situation concerning the

<p>For the requirement of communicability of the circumstances and
results of experiments implies that we can speak of well defined
experiences only within the framework of ordinary concepts. In
particular it should not be forgotten that the concept of causality

even in the coordination of experience one can never, in the nature of
things, have to do with well-defined breaks in the causal chain. <span

<p>I hope by these remarks to have conveyed the impression that in
abandoning the causal description in atomic physics we are not con-
cerned with a hasty assertion of the impossibility of comprehending the

type of laws here encountered in conformity with the general lesson of
philosophy regarding the necessity of a balance between analysis and
synthesis. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr37causal">(<a

<p>In case, however — as in the region of quantum phenomena — this
interaction plays an essential role for the appearance of the phenomena
themselves, the situation is completely changed, and we are in
particular forced to renounce the combination, characteristic of
classical physical description, of the space-time coordination of the
event with the general conservation theorems of dynamics. For the use of
rods and clocks to fix the system of reference makes it by definition
impossible to take into account the energy of momentum which might be
transferred to them in the course of the phenomenon. Conversely, those
quantum laws whose formulation rests essentially on the application of
the concept of energy or momentum can appear only under circumstances of
investigation from which a detailed account of the space-time behavior
of the object is excluded. <span class="citation"

<p>The fundamentally statistical character of quantum mechanics which is
expressed in Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations is indeed not a
temporary restriction of the analysis of atomic events, but it
corresponds in an appropriate manner to the point of view of
complementarity, which is more comprehensive than the ideal of
causality, and necessary in order to account for the wealth of
experiences depending on the existence of the quantum of action. <span

structure of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>-spectra, which
created, with the interpretation of optical spectra as a model, the

nuclei. In the first place this consisted — contrary to the analysis of

<p>Due to the essentially statistical character of the thermodynamical

<p>The view-point of complementarity allows us indeed to avoid any

<p>The causal mode of description has deep roots in the conscious
endeavours to utilize experience for the practical adjustment to our
environments, and is in this way inherently incorporated in common
language. By the guidance which analysis in terms of cause and effect
has offered in many fields of human knowledge, the principle of
causality has even come to stand as the ideal for scientific
explanation. <span class="citation" data-cites="notions">(<a

<p>However, a wholly new situation in physical science was created
through the discovery of the universal quantum of action, which revealed
an elementary feature of ‘individuality’ of atomic processes far beyond
the old doctrine of the limited divisibility of matter originally
introduced as a foundation for a causal explanation of the specific
properties of material substances. This novel feature is not only
entirely foreign to the classical theories of mechanics and
electromagnetism, but is even irreconcilable with the very idea of
causality. <span class="citation" data-cites="notions">(<a

<p>These so-called indeterminacy relations explicitly bear out the
limitation of causal analysis, but it is important to recognize that no
unambiguous interpretation of such relations can be given in words

<p>Recapitulating, the impossibility of subdividing the individual
quantum effects and of separating a behaviour of the objects from their
interaction with the measuring instruments serving to define the
conditions under which thc phenomena appear implies an ambiguity in
assigning conventional attributes to atomic objects which calls for a
reconsideration of our attitude towards the problem of physical
explanation. In this novel situation, even the old question of an
ultimate determinacy of natural phenomena has lost its conceptional
basis, and it is against this background that the viewpoint of
complementarity presents itself as a rational generalization of the very
ideal of causality. <span class="citation" data-cites="notions">(<a

<p>In particular, the place left for the feeling of volition is afforded
by the very circumstance that situations where we experience freedom of
will are incompatible with psychological situations where causal
analysis is reasonably attempted. In other words, when we use the phrase
‘I will’ we renounce explanatory argumentation. <span class="citation"

<p>A sentence like “we cannot know both the momentum and the position of
an electron” raises at once questions as to the physical reality of such
two attributes, which can be answered only by referring to the mutually
exclusive conditions for the unambiguous use of space-time coordination,
on the one hand, and dynamical conservation laws, on the other. <span
