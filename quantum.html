<h1 class="title">Is quantum mechanics irrational?</h1>
<p class="author">Hans Halvorson</p>
</header>
<p>The following is my reading guide for students who want to get
started thinking about the philosophical issues that arise in quantum
mechanics.</p>
<p>It was claimed from the very start (1910s and 20s) that the attempt
to push physical theory into the subatomic realm met up with some
challenging philosophical issues. These issues engaged the early
pioneers of quantum mechanics for two decades – until the European
scientific community was decimated by a hateful political movement. When
the balance of power in physics moved to North America, these more
conceptual discussions were all but forgotten. So, whatever conceptual
innovations were made in the 1920s and 30s, these were unknown to
physicists in the latter half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, the fact that quantum physics isn’t just “physics
as usual” was clearly realized by John Bell, David Bohm, Hugh Everett,
etc. (Unfortunately these revolutionaries never got to discuss with
Niels Bohr and the other conceptually minded physicists of the earlier
generation.) In the third decade of the 21st century, there is now a
small minority of physicists who think actively about the foundations of
quantum physics, along side a small community of philosophers of
science. Unfortunately, disciplinary boundaries sometimes get in the way
of conceptual progress, and I hope that this document will be of some
small help in overcoming those problems.</p>
<h2 id="wake-up-call">Wake up call</h2>
<p>If you want to get a “wake-up call” for why there is a serious
problem with textbook quantum mechanics, then read <span
class="citation" data-cites="albert">Albert (1994)</span> . Albert’s
book is a locus classicus for the quantum <strong>measurement
problem</strong>, and he also describes some of the main ways of
attempting to solve this problem – i.e. interpretations of quantum
mechanics.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things in Albert’s book that are tendentious —
but that’s why it’s exciting! I would say that it’s a bit uncharitable
to treat QM as a “statistical algorithm” that only makes predictions.
Perhaps that is the way that some, or even many, physicists use QM. But
perhaps others manage to use it in a way that leads them to make true
descriptions of things that happen before or after measurements, or more
generally, of things that cannot be seen by the human eye. So to say
that QM is <em>only</em> a statistical algorithm seems a bit
uncharitable.</p>
<p>For an even more clear statement of what the measurement problem is
supposed to be, see <span class="citation"
data-cites="maudlin-three">(Maudlin 1995)</span>. Maudlin’s
demonstration of the measurement problem gives a convenient way of
classifying interpretations of QM based on which assumption they give
up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Measurements have outcomes</p></li>
<li><p>Linear dynamics</p></li>
<li><p>The wavefunction is complete</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The work by Albert, Maudlin, et al. develops themes that occur
already in the collection of articles by John Bell <span
class="citation" data-cites="speakable">(2004)</span>. But I don’t buy
into the narrative that John Bell uncovered problems in QM that were
shoved aside by the pioneers of the field – i.e. the narrative the Bohr
et al. ignored these problems, and silenced those who raised them. (This
narrative can be found in books by <span class="citation"
data-cites="beller">Beller (1999)</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="becker">Becker (2018)</span>, and is presupposed in rather a
lot of the journal articles published by philosophers.) Every bit of
historical evidence suggests that Bohr, in particular, spent his entire
life thinking about the philosophical issues at stake in quantum
physics.</p>
<h2
id="does-quantum-mechanics-break-the-rules-of-logic-or-probability-theory">Does
quantum mechanics break the rules of logic (or probability theory)?</h2>
<p>In the early days of quantum theory it did surely seem like the laws
of logic were in danger of being broken. There were experiments that
seemed to indicate that the underlying material was wavelike, and other
experiments that seemed to indicate that the underlying material was
particulate. But waves are not particles, so it looked like the world
simply didn’t make sense to human logic. (Heisenberg’s “solution” was to
stop trying to say what the world is like.)</p>
<p>There are other ways in which the quantum world seemed to defy
standard laws of rationality. Take, for example, the idea that every
event must have a cause. Well, quantum theory said that an electron
might spontaneously transition from one energy level to another with no
antecedent cause. So that seems like yet another sense in which quantum
mechanics defies the laws of rationality.</p>
<p>Or take more recent experiments that indicate that two things that
are distant in space from each other can be “entangled” in a way that
simply doesn’t make sense according to common sense intuitions. One can
even sometimes here people say things like “a particle can be in two
places at one time”. But that kind of claim really goes beyond what the
theory actually says. It doesn’t say that one thing can be in two places
at a single time. It only says that two things can behave in a way that
is hard to explain by treating them as separate individuals.</p>
<p>For a student who has actually learned some real formal logic, there
is a more precise question to be asked, viz. whether quantum mechanics
tells us that some of the rules of formal logic are simply wrong. That
is a real live debate, and people have some quite strong opinions about
it. I would say that the recent consensus is that quantum mechanics
doesn’t say anything that directly impinges on the laws of classical
formal logic. But that wasn’t always the favored opinion. In a famous
article, the philosopher Hilary Putnam argued that QM demands a revision
of logic <span class="citation" data-cites="putnam">Putnam
(1968)</span>. If you look (e.g. on Google scholar) at all the responses
to that article, then you will see not only that many people have argued
against it, but that even Putnam himself gave up this idea.</p>
<p>There has been a bit of a recent flareup in discussions about quantum
logic. See <span class="citation"
data-cites="maudlin-logic kripke williamson">(Maudlin 2005; Kripke 2023;
Williamson 2018)</span></p>
<p>For an elegant formal approach to quantum logic, without much
philosophical drama, see <span class="citation"
data-cites="gibbins">(Gibbins 1987)</span>. There are interesting
mathematical questions here as well – in particular, about the
relationship of quantum logic to other substructural logics.</p>
<h2 id="adopting-an-interpretation">Adopting an interpretation</h2>
<p>If one starts to get serious about a particular interpretation of QM,
then the question is: what to do with it? At risk of grossly
caricaturing, Bohmians have a scientific task: develop extensions of
Bohmian mechanics to capture more real physical situations. (David
Wallace is not optimistic about their chances <span class="citation"
data-cites="wallace-sky">(Wallace 2023)</span>.) In contrast,
Everettians have a philosophical task: explain how we can get our heads
around this metaphysical picture that is so alien to common sense.</p>
<h2 id="hot-topics">Hot topics</h2>
<h3 id="everett-many-worlds">Everett (Many Worlds)</h3>
<p>To call Everett a “hot topic” is about 15 years behind the times. The
topic got hot again in the early 2000s, thanks to (among others) David
Wallace. It has now moved into a more stable development and
articulation phase, I would say. There are lots of problems and
sub-problems still to be worked out. My sense is that of all the
interpretations on offer, Everett is the closest to a “worldview”.</p>
<h3 id="wavefunction-realism">Wavefunction realism</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: the quantum wavefunction is a real thing. This
view has been developed by Alyssa Ney, and defended in some places by
Sean Carroll. I myself have criticized the view in print <span
class="citation" data-cites="tobe">(Halvorson 2019)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="qbism">QBism</h3>
<p>A radical, and potentially interesting idea, propelled forward by the
growth of quantum computing and information theory. What if the whole
point of the quantum revolution is that physics should no longer try to
say how things are? I haven’t been following the latest in QBism, but if
you google it, and also keyword “Chris Fuchs”, you’ll find plenty to
read. One very interesting thing about QBism is that it makes you
thinker harder about the interpretation of probability – i.e. when you
say that an event has a 50% chance of occuring, what exactly are you
saying (if anything) about the world?</p>
<h3 id="relational-quantum-mechanics">Relational quantum mechanics</h3>
<p>This is the bespoke interpretation of Carlo Rovelli. There is much
more to say about it, both in terms of why it’s so well motivated
(i.e. it’s a beautiful idea) and in terms of skepticism about whether it
works.</p>
<h3 id="healeys-pragmatic-turn">Healey’s pragmatic turn</h3>
<p>Richard Healey has been doing some creative thinking about what
quantum physics means. For a start, see his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="healey">(Healey 2017)</span>.</p>
