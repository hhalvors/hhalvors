<h1 class="title">Is quantum mechanics irrational?</h1>
<p class="author">Hans Halvorson</p>
</header>
<p>The following is an opinionated reading guide for students who want
to get started thinking about the philosophical issues that arise in
quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It was claimed from the very start (1910s and 20s) that the attempt
to push physical theory into the subatomic realm meets some challenging
philosophical issues. These issues engaged the pioneers of quantum
mechanics for two decades – until the European scientific community,
with its rich history of philosophical debate, was decimated by a
hateful political movement. When the balance of power in institutional
science moved to North America, the more conceptual discussions of
physics were mostly left behind. Whatever <em>conceptual</em>
innovations were achieved in the 1920s and 30s seem not to have survived
into the physics of the latter half of the 20th century. (In contrast,
the technical and even mathematical innovations survived and
flourished.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, the fact that quantum physics isn’t just “physics as
usual” was clearly realized by John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett.
(Unfortunately this second wave of quantum philosophers never got to
talk things through with Niels Bohr and the other conceptually minded
physicists of the previous generation. They might have found the
discussions to be rather fruitful, in the same way that Einstein and
Schroedinger found it fruitful to talk with Bohr and Heisenberg.) At
present – nearly a third of the way through the 21st century – there is
rather small minority of physicists who think actively about the
foundations of quantum physics, alongside a small community of
philosophers who are savvy about physics. Unfortunately, disciplinary
boundaries have often impeded conceptual progress, and I hope that this
document will be of some small help in overcoming that problem.</p>
<h2 id="wake-up-call">Wake up call</h2>
<p>For a “wake-up call” about what’s wrong with textbook quantum
mechanics, see <span class="citation" data-cites="albert">(Albert
1994)</span>. Albert’s book is a locus classicus for the quantum
<strong>measurement problem</strong>, and he also describes some of the
main ways of attempting to solve this problem – i.e. interpretations of
quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things in Albert’s book that are tendentious —
but that’s why it’s exciting! I would say that it’s a bit uncharitable
to treat QM as a “statistical algorithm” that only makes predictions.
Perhaps that is the way that some, or even many, physicists use QM. But
perhaps others manage to use it in a way that leads them to make true
descriptions of things that happen before or after measurements, or more
generally, of things that cannot be seen by the human eye. So to say
that QM is <em>only</em> a statistical algorithm seems a bit
uncharitable.</p>
<p>For an even more clear statement of what the measurement problem is
supposed to be, see <span class="citation"
data-cites="maudlin-three">(Maudlin 1995)</span>. Maudlin’s derivation
of the measurement problem gives a convenient way of classifying
interpretations of QM based on which assumption they give up. He argues
that the following three assumptions are inconsistent:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Linear dynamics</p></li>
<li><p>The wavefunction is complete</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements have outcomes</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Collapse interpretations give up the first, hidden variable
interpretations give up the second, and the Everett interpretation gives
up the third.</p>
<p>The work by Albert, Maudlin, Ct al. develops themes that begin the
articles by John Bell in the 1960s and 70s. These articles are collected
in <span class="citation" data-cites="speakable">(Bell 2004)</span>. But
I don’t buy into the narrative – so popular in recent years – that John
Bell uncovered problems in QM that were shoved aside by the pioneers of
the field – i.e. the narrative the Bohr et al. ignored these problems,
and silenced those who raised them. (This narrative can be found in
books by <span class="citation" data-cites="beller">Beller (1999)</span>
and <span class="citation" data-cites="becker">Becker (2018)</span>, and
is presupposed in rather a lot of the journal articles published by
philosophers.) Every bit of historical evidence suggests that Bohr, in
particular, would have been happy to renegotiate the philosophical
issues into all eternity.</p>
<h2
id="does-quantum-mechanics-break-the-rules-of-logic-or-probability-theory">Does
quantum mechanics break the rules of logic (or probability theory)?</h2>
<p>In the early days of quantum theory it did certainly seem like the
laws of logic were in danger of being broken. There were experiments
that seemed to indicate that the underlying material was wavelike, and
other experiments that seemed to indicate that the underlying material
was particulate. But waves are not particles, so it looked like the
world simply didn’t make sense to human logic. (Heisenberg’s “solution”
– at first! – was to be silent about things that cannot be
observed.)</p>
<p>There are other ways in which the quantum world seemed to defy the
laws of rationality. Take, for example, the idea that every event must
have a cause. Well, quantum theory said that an electron might
spontaneously transition from one energy level to another with no
antecedent cause. So that seems like yet another sense in which quantum
mechanics defies the laws of rationality. (Bohr himself had contemplated
giving up on the conservation of energy, but he eventually decided that
QM does <em>not</em> violate that principle.)</p>
<p>Or take more recent experiments that indicate that two things that
are distant in space from each other can be “entangled” in a way that
simply doesn’t make sense according to common sense intuitions. One can
even sometimes here people say things like “a particle can be in two
places at one time”. But that kind of claim really goes beyond what the
theory actually says. It doesn’t say that one thing can be in two places
at a single time. It only says that two things can behave in a way that
is hard to explain by treating them as separate individuals. See <a
href="#nonlocality">nonlocality</a></p>
<p>For a student who has learned some formal logic, there is a more
precise question to be asked, viz. whether QM demands that we revise the
rules of logic. That is a real live debate, and people have some quite
strong opinions about it. I would say that the recent consensus is that
quantum mechanics doesn’t say anything that directly impinges on the
laws of classical formal logic. But that wasn’t always the favored
opinion. In an infamous article, Hilary Putnam argued that QM demands a
revision of logic <span class="citation" data-cites="putnam">(Putnam
1968)</span>. If you look (e.g. on Google scholar) at all the responses
to that article, then you will see not only that many people have argued
against it, and even Putnam himself eventually decided it was
misguided.</p>
<p>There has been a bit of a recent flareup in discussions about quantum
logic. See <span class="citation"
data-cites="maudlin-logic kripke williamson">(Maudlin 2005; Kripke 2023;
Williamson 2018)</span></p>
<p>For a rigorous approach to quantum logic, without much philosophical
drama, see <span class="citation" data-cites="gibbins">(Gibbins
1987)</span>. There are interesting technical questions here as well –
in particular, about the relationship of quantum logic to other
substructural logics (such as linear or relevance logic). Some people
have seem interesting parallels between quantum mechanics and
intuitionistic logic, but nobody seems yet to have found a rigorous
formal correspondence.</p>
<h2 id="nonlocality">Nonlocality</h2>
<p>As a formal, quantifiable feature of models, the notion of
<strong>quantum nonlocality</strong> was born with the proof of Bell’s
theorem in 1965. (Bell’s paper “On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox”
is reprinted in his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="speakable">(Bell 2004)</span>.) The underlying issue of
<strong>entanglement</strong> had been identified at least thirty years
prior by Schroedinger and Bohr, and was exploited in the infamous
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument.</p>
<p>There is one clear sense in which Bell’s inequality is a consequence
of classical probability theory. One might be tempted then to conclude
that the violation of Bell’s inequality in QM shows that classical
probability theory is false. There was some debate along these lines in
the 1970s and 80s, with the work of Arthur Fine, Itamar Pitowski, etc.
However, others insist that the violation of Bell’s inequality is about
locality and not at all about probability theory.</p>
<h2 id="adopting-an-interpretation">Adopting an interpretation</h2>
<p>If one starts to get serious about a particular interpretation of QM,
then the question is: what to do with it? At risk of grossly
caricaturing, Bohmians have a scientific task: develop extensions of
Bohmian mechanics to capture more real physical situations. (David
Wallace is not optimistic about their chances <span class="citation"
data-cites="wallace-sky">(Wallace 2023)</span>.) In contrast,
Everettians have a philosophical task: explain how we can get our heads
around this metaphysical picture that is so alien to common sense.</p>
<h2 id="hot-topics">Hot topics</h2>
<h3 id="everett-many-worlds">Everett (Many Worlds)</h3>
<p>To call Everett a “hot topic” is about 15 years behind the times. The
topic got hot again in the early 2000s, thanks to (among others) David
Wallace. It has now moved into a more stable development and
articulation phase, I would say. There are lots of problems and
sub-problems still to be worked out. My sense is that of all the
interpretations on offer, Everett is the closest to a “worldview”.</p>
<h3 id="wavefunction-realism">Wavefunction realism</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: the quantum wavefunction is a real thing. This
view has been developed by Alyssa Ney <span class="citation"
data-cites="ney2013">(Ney and Albert 2013)</span>, and defended by Sean
Carroll. I myself have criticized the view in print <span
class="citation" data-cites="tobe">(Halvorson 2019)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="qbism">QBism</h3>
<p>A radical, and potentially interesting idea, propelled forward by the
growth of quantum computing and information theory. What if the whole
point of the quantum revolution is that physics should no longer try to
say how things are? I haven’t been following the latest in QBism, but if
you google it, and also keyword “Chris Fuchs”, you’ll find plenty to
read. One very interesting thing about QBism is that it makes you think
hard about the interpretation of probability – i.e. when you say that an
event has a 50% chance of occurring, what exactly are you saying about
the world? QBism also requires one to think about big issues regarding
objectivity and subjectivity, and the goals of science. (In this sense,
John Bell would have called QBism a “romantic interpretation” of QM –
which for him was a derogatory term.)</p>
<h3 id="relational-quantum-mechanics">Relational quantum mechanics</h3>
<p>This is the bespoke interpretation of Carlo Rovelli. There is much
more to say about it, both in terms of why it’s such an interesting
idea, and in terms of skepticism about whether it works.</p>
<h3 id="healeys-pragmatic-turn">Healey’s pragmatic turn</h3>
<p>Richard Healey has been doing some creative thinking about what
quantum physics means. For a start, see his book <span class="citation"
data-cites="healey">(Healey 2017)</span>. The view has now been further
developed in several articles. Healey’s view shares features in common
with Bohr, Rovelli, and QBism.</p>
<h2 id="popular-science">Popular science</h2>
<p>Since quantum physics is so exotic, there is quite a lot of
interesting popular science literature about it. While this genre does
not generally encourage philosophical rigor, the philosopher can still
benefit quite a lot from these perspectives. One older book that I find
to be quite good is <span class="citation" data-cites="herbert">(Herbert
2011)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="additional-resources">Additional resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can read many articles about the philosophy of quantum
mechanics in the <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=quantum">Stanford
Online Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>. These articles are written by
reputable authors, and are reviewed by professional editors. They are
trustworthy, and can be cited in academic work.</p></li>
<li><p>Further papers and bibliographic guides can be found at: <a
href="https://philpapers.org/browse/quantum-mechanics">PhilPapers</a>
But unfortunately, this resource focuses on those papers that are
written by “professional philosophers” and/or that appear in “philosophy
journals”, while some interesting philosophy is done by physicists
and/or appears in physics journals.</p></li>
