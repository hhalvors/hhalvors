I currently have three main projects that give focus to my research.

# Niels Bohr: Philosopher in Action

An intellectual biography of Niels Bohr (Joint work with Anja Skaar
Jacobsen)

# Philosophical Lessons of the Theory of Relativity

Relativity theory might seem far less philosophically exciting than
quantum physics, and far easier to read literally, i.e. as a story
about how things are (in themselves). In fact, one might say that
there is something of a consensus among philosophers about how to read
relativity theory. But that has not always been the case --- and I'm
convinced that if there is a consensus now, then it rests on some
indefensible presuppositions.
   
# Meta-Philosophy and Theoretical Equivalence

It's possible to make up some precise (mathematically rigorous)
versions of familiar concepts. For example, in the 19th century,
mathematicians came up with definitions for concepts such as a
function being continuous, or of a collection being infinite. In the
20th century, mathematical logicians continued this practice by
proposing definitions for concepts such as provability, truth (in a
structure), and equivalence (of theories).

But some philosophers complain about this methodology, saying that the
notion of equivalence is "not formal", or even more extremely, that
it's a bad idea to talk about *theories* in the first place -- rather
than about more solid things such as *facts*. I remain convinced that
meta-theoretic concepts (i.e. concepts about our thinking and how it
relates to the world) are useful, and that explication is a valuable
practice. But it's important to clarify what we attend to achieve via
this methodology.
