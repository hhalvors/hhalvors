<p>I currently have three main projects that give focus to my
research.</p>
<h1 id="niels-bohr-philosopher-in-action">Niels Bohr: Philosopher in
Action</h1>
<p>An intellectual biography of Niels Bohr (Joint work with Anja Skaar
Jacobsen)</p>
<h1 id="philosophical-lessons-of-the-theory-of-relativity">Philosophical
Lessons of the Theory of Relativity</h1>
<p>Relativity theory might seem far less philosophically exciting than
quantum physics, and far easier to read literally, i.e. as a story about
how things are (in themselves). In fact, one might say that there is
something of a consensus among philosophers about how to read relativity
theory. But that has not always been the case — and I’m convinced that
if there is a consensus now, then it rests on some indefensible
presuppositions.</p>
<h1 id="meta-philosophy-and-theoretical-equivalence">Meta-Philosophy and
Theoretical Equivalence</h1>
<p>It’s possible to make up some precise (mathematically rigorous)
versions of familiar concepts. For example, in the 19th century,
mathematicians came up with definitions for concepts such as a function
being continuous, or of a collection being infinite. In the 20th
century, mathematical logicians continued this practice by proposing
definitions for concepts such as provability, truth (in a structure),
and equivalence (of theories).</p>
<p>But some philosophers complain about this methodology, saying that
the notion of equivalence is “not formal”, or even more extremely, that
it’s a bad idea to talk about <em>theories</em> in the first place –
rather than about more solid things such as <em>facts</em>. I remain
convinced that meta-theoretic concepts (i.e. concepts about our thinking
and how it relates to the world) are useful, and that explication is a
valuable practice. But it’s important to clarify what we attend to
achieve via this methodology.</p>
