  <h1 id="current-research">Current research</h1>
  <p>I currently have three main projects that give focus to my
    research.</p>

  <h2 id="niels-bohr-philosopher-in-action">1. Niels Bohr: Philosopher in
    Action</h2>

  <p>An intellectual biography of Niels Bohr (Joint work with Anja Skaar
    Jacobsen)</p>

  <h2 id="philosophical-lessons-of-the-theory-of-relativity">2. Philosophical
    Lessons of the Theory of Relativity</h2>

  <p>Relativity theory might seem less philosophically provocative
    than quantum physics, and easier to read literally, i.e. as
    telling us how things are (in themselves). In fact, one might say
    that there is something of a consensus among philosophers about
    how to read relativity theory. But that has not always been the
    case — and I’m convinced that if there is a consensus now, then it
    rests on some indefensible presuppositions.</p>

  <h2 id="meta-philosophy-and-theoretical-equivalence">3. Metatheory and
    Theoretical Equivalence</h2>

  <p>It’s possible to make up some precise (mathematically rigorous)
versions of familiar concepts. For example, in the 19th century,
mathematicians came up with definitions for concepts such as a
function being continuous, or of a collection being infinite. In the
20th century, mathematical logicians continued this practice by
proposing definitions for concepts such as provability, truth (in a
structure), and equivalence (of theories).</p>
  
<p>But some philosophers complain about this methodology, saying that
the notion of equivalence is “not formal”, or even more extremely,
that it’s a bad idea to talk about <em>theories</em> in the first
place – rather than about more solid things such as <em>facts</em>. I
remain convinced that meta-theoretic concepts (i.e. concepts about our
representations and how they relate to the world) are useful, and that
explication of such concepts is a valuable practice. But it’s
important to clarify what we attend to achieve via this
  methodology.</p>

<h1>Answers to questions</h1>

<p>Here I post some short pieces, mostly in response to questions from
  students.</p>

  <p><b>Differential geometry.</b> It has seemed to many people that
  there is something special about the theoretical representation
  provided by differential geometry. Some more sophisticated types
  would say that what's special about differential geometry is
  captured by something even more general, viz. fiber bundle
  theory. That's an interesting thing to reflect upon, and it connects
  with the philosophical questions about gauge theories --- which is a
  huge topic. Nonetheless, here are some scattered thoughts about
  differential geometry.

    <ul><li>Hermann Weyl certainly thought that there was something
    special about differential geometry. But where to read about that?
    I might start by looking at the work of Tom Ryckman.</li>
     <li>Saunders Mac Lane gives an elegant introduction to
     differential geometry for analytical mechanics in some lecture
     notes from the late 1960s. For more on analytic mechanics and
     differential geometry, see Claude Godbillon, <i>Géométrie
     différentielle et mécanique analytique</i>.</li></ul>
