<h1 id="current-research">Current research</h1>
<p>I currently have three main projects that give focus to my
research.</p>
<h2 id="niels-bohr-philosopher-in-action">Niels Bohr: Philosopher in
Action</h2>
<p>An intellectual biography of Niels Bohr (Joint work with Anja Skaar
Jacobsen)</p>
<h2 id="philosophical-lessons-of-the-theory-of-relativity">Philosophical
Lessons of the Theory of Relativity</h2>
<p>Relativity theory might seem less philosophically provocative than
quantum physics, and easier to read literally, i.e. as telling us how
things are (in themselves). In fact, one might say that there is
something of a consensus among philosophers about how to read relativity
theory. But that has not always been the case — and I’m convinced that
if there is a consensus now, then it rests on some indefensible
presuppositions.</p>
<h2 id="meta-philosophy-and-theoretical-equivalence">Meta-Philosophy and
Theoretical Equivalence</h2>
<p>It’s possible to make up some precise (mathematically rigorous)
versions of familiar concepts. For example, in the 19th century,
mathematicians came up with definitions for concepts such as a function
being continuous, or of a collection being infinite. In the 20th
century, mathematical logicians continued this practice by proposing
definitions for concepts such as provability, truth (in a structure),
and equivalence (of theories).</p>
<p>But some philosophers complain about this methodology, saying that
the notion of equivalence is “not formal”, or even more extremely, that
it’s a bad idea to talk about <em>theories</em> in the first place –
rather than about more solid things such as <em>facts</em>. I remain
convinced that meta-theoretic concepts (i.e. concepts about our
representations and how they relate to the world) are useful, and that
explication of such concepts is a valuable practice. But it’s important
to clarify what we attend to achieve via this methodology.</p>
