<div class="card"><h3 id="philosophical-lessons-of-the-theory-of-relativity">Philosophical
Lessons of the Theory of Relativity</h3>

  <p>Relativity theory might seem less philosophically provocative
  than quantum physics, and easier to read literally, i.e., as telling
  us how things are (in themselves). In fact, one might say that there
  is something of a consensus among philosophers about how to read
  relativity theory. But that has not always been the case — and I’m
  convinced that if there is a consensus now, then it rests on some
  indefensible presuppositions.</p></div>

  <div class="card"><h3 id="meta-philosophy-and-theoretical-equivalence">Metatheory and Theoretical Equivalence</h3>
  <p>It’s possible to make up some precise (mathematically rigorous)
  versions of familiar concepts. For example, in the 19th century,
  mathematicians came up with definitions for concepts such as a
  function being continuous, or of a collection being infinite. In the
  20th century, mathematical logicians continued this practice by
  proposing definitions for concepts such as provability, truth (in a
  structure), and equivalence (of theories).</p>
  
  <p>But some philosophers complain about this methodology, saying
  that the notion of equivalence is not "formal", or even more
  extremely, that it's a bad idea to talk about <em>theories</em> in
  the first place – rather than about more solid things such
  as <em>facts</em>. I remain convinced that meta-theoretic concepts
  (i.e., concepts about our representations and how they relate to the
  world) are useful, and that explication of such concepts is a
  valuable practice. But it’s important to clarify what we attend to
    achieve via this methodology.</p></div>

  <div class="card"><h3 id="kierkegaard">Kierkegaard</h3>
    <p>Not only is Kierkegaard interesting, he's also a central part
    of the philosophical backstory to Niels Bohr. (Kierkegaard died
    thirty years before Bohr was born, and the intellectual
    connections between them are extensive.) The German idealists
    thought that they knew what "objectivity" is <i>qua</i> epistemic
    goal. But Kierkegaard has many arguments to the effect that the
    German idealists don't know what they are talking about.</p>
