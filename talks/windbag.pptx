\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rasmus Nielsen was a 19th century philosopher from Copenhagen whose
  work has been completely forgotten.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you've heard of him, that's probably because he's mentioned in
    some Kierkegaard biographies.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Not a single page of thousands that Nielsen wrote has been translated
  to another language.
\item
  I will begin by explaining reasons to be interested in Nielsen --- not
  just for historians, but also for contemporary philosophers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Four reasons to be interested in Nielsen}
\protect\hypertarget{four-reasons-to-be-interested-in-nielsen}{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Kierkegaard
\item
  Niels Bohr
\item
  Nielsen upsets standard narratives about the origins of analytic
  philosophy
\item
  Nielsen has an interesting view about faith and reason
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Kierkegaard}
\protect\hypertarget{kierkegaard}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Nielsen's relevance for Kierkegaard studies is described well in Jon
  Stewart, ``Rasmus Nielsen: From the object of `prodigious concern' to
  a `windbag'\,''
\item
  Nielsen deserves most credit for transmitting SK's ideas to subsequent
  generations (Brandes, Høffding, etc.)
\item
  Nielsen is ``patient zero'' for reception and transformation of SK's
  ideas

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Both Brandes and Høffding got to know about Kierkegaard from
    Nielsen's lectures
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Nielsen's career runs parallel with H.L. Martensen's

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If Martensen was between SK and Hegel, then Nielsen was between SK
    and Martensen
  \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Bohr}
\protect\hypertarget{bohr}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  My project began with wanting to make sense, philosophically, of
  contemporary physics. What do all of these new discoveries mean for
  us?
\item
  Niels Bohr had wrestled with such questions more than anyone else
\item
  But contemporary philosophers are either uninterested in Bohr, or say
  that they cannot make sense of him, or say that he was obviously wrong
\end{itemize}

  Contemporary philosophers accuse Bohr of being a logical positivst
\item

\item
  But Denmark has its own philosophical tradition that doesn't fit
  neatly into the ``world historic'' classification scheme
\item
  I was struck by thematic similarities between Bohr's philosophy and
  Kierkegaard's

  At a given moment in history, philosophers from prevailing cultures
  tend to see the history of philosophy as leading up to them

\begin{block}{Challenging the dominant narratives}
\protect\hypertarget{challenging-the-dominant-narratives}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  These narratives portray the development as linear. E.g. the
  positivists make philosophy scientific, and then Quine shows that is
  not quite scientific enough
\item
  Compare and contrast the Danish \emph{opgør} with Hegel with the
  English (Russell and Moore), which gave birth to analytic philosophy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The English response doesn't have much religion in it
  \item
    Both reject monism in favor of pluralism
  \item
    The Danish response leads more quickly to a new kind of philosophy
    of nature
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Nielsen's philosophy has several things in common with neo-kantianism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The relativized apriori
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Nielsen offers a distinctly modern conception of the relationship
  between philosophy and the natural sciences

{[}2{]} But the assumption of duæ veritates ceases to denote a dispute

undecided in the other. (1864, p 23)

\begin{quote}
Every unambiguous communication about the state and activity of our mind
implies of course a separation between the content of our consciousness
and the background loosely referred to as ``ourselves'', but any attempt
at exhaustive description of the richness of conscious life demands in
various situations a different placing of the section between subject
and object.

In order to illustrate this important point, I shall quote a Danish poet
and philosopher, Poul Martin Møller, who lived about a hundred years ago
and left behind an unfinished novel called ``The Adventures of a Danish
Student'', in which the author gives a remarkably vivid and suggestive
account of the interplay between the various aspects of our position

\begin{quote}
Actually, ordinary language, by its use of such words as thoughts and
sentiments, admits typical complementary relation between conscious
experiences implying a different placing of the section line between the
observing subject and the object on which attention is focussed. We are
here presented with a close analogy to the relationship between atomic
phenomena appearing under different experimental conditions and
described by different physical concepts, according to the role played
by the measuring instruments. In fact, the varying separation line
between subject and object, characteristic of different conscious
experiences, is the clue to the consistent logical use of such
contrasting notions as will, conscience and aspirations, each referring
to equally important aspects of the human personality. (Bohr 1953, pp
389-390)

In emphasizing the necessity of paying proper attention to the plac- ing

\textbf{Objectiveringslov}

\begin{quote}
{[}3{]} No Object without a corresponding Objectification; it is an a
priori law that underwrites all empiricism, a basic law that in science
is, if possible, even more unshakable than Newton's law of gravity. From
this it can be seen, that a critical boundary, a boundary line, on whose
one side we have the objectivizing subjectivity, while the object is
standing on the other side, is confusing and meaningless. (1880, p 41)

\begin{quote}
Her fremsætter Nielsen den «Objektiveringslov», som senere blev et saa
betydningsfuldt Led i hans Metafysik: Objekterne kan ikke objektivere
sig selv, og da Objekter uden Objektivering er umulige, forudsætter
Objektiviteten en objektiverende Subjektivitet. Paa den anden Side kan
Subjektiviteten ikke undvære Objektiviteten, eftersom dens Selvbegriben
og Selvmagt saa vilde blive uden Indhold. Opfatter vi Forholdet
udialektisk faar vi en kriiisk Adskillelse som hos Kant, der ganske
fornagler Problemet om Subjektets og Objektets indbyrdes Forhold, eller
en mystisk Realisme som hos Schelling, der fortoner Problemet i Taage.
Men naar Objektiviteten og den bærende Subjektivitet paa ethvert Punkt
dialektisk ses at forudsætte hianden, da forstaas «Naturens aandrige
Aandløshed», og man øjner Muligheden af Problemets Løsning --- saavidt
muligt er paa menneskelige Vilkaar. (Rosenberg p 13)

{[}4{]} Nielsen imagined that to describe the interrelationship between
the subjective and the objective, or as he calls it, knowledge and
power, an infinite analysis would be needed, since every subject
presupposes an object, and every object in turn a subject. When one does
not want to conclude in a speculative and theological way, it becomes a
duel without end.

\ldots{} Nielsen did not perceive the matter in this way. His way of
thinking was that since every object must be objectified,
i.e.~presupposes a subject, and since the human subject cannot perceive
(objectify) everything, there must, if the reality of objects is to be
asserted, be an absolute (`ontological') subject for whom the absolute
reality exists.

He overlooks the fact that the game must begin again here; even a God
would be bound to the Law of the Relation between Subject and Subject
and Object. The attempt to justify an abstract theism through
\emph{Grundideernes Logik} has therefore not succeeded. We could not get
further than to determine and describe a subject in relation to which
certain phenomena (objects) apply, just as the astronomer must determine
a point (on the earth, on the sun, or wherever) from which the positions
and movements of the celestial bodies could be described as if they were
absolute. (Høffding 1909, p 189-190)

Nielsen endorses methodological naturalism

\begin{quote}
The deeper science penetrates into some state of affairs, all the more
clear it becomes that these challenges in their parts as on the whole,
in the smallest as in the largest, are solved in a natural way and by
natural means. (1862, p 187)

  Nielsen refers to Darwin's \emph{Origin of Species} in his 1861
  lectures --- the first reference in the Danish literature
\item
  ``Et synspunkt for Darwinisme'' (1873). Nielsen argues that accepting
  Darwinian evolution is fully consistent with Christian doctrines of
  creation, fall, etc.

Nielsen rejects the idea of a single absolute science.

\begin{quote}
What Schelling calls ``science itself'' cannot possibly survive ``the
sciences'' (1880, p 72)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
That each distinct science must have its distinct starting point,
conditional upon substance on topic, follows from the nature of the
matter. (1880, p 89)

  Low-hanging fruit in research on 19th century Danish philosophers

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Reading and interpreting Nielsen's books is a big job: Danish,
    fraktur, mathematics, etc.
  \item
    Nielsen's handwritten papers in KB
  \item
    Notes by students in KB

  Can we say something more specific about what triggered Nielsen's turn

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What role does the concept of power (\emph{Magt}) play for Martensen
  and Nielsen?
\item
  The notion of ``objectivering'' appears in \emph{Den Propædeutiske
  Logik} (1845). Does it appear elsewhere before that?
\item
  Did Nielsen know about non-euclidean geometry, and did that influence
  his view about the moveable apriori?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does RN represent a betrayal of SK's ideas, or an innovative
  application of these ideas to a life with more typically modern
  concerns?
\item
  Does RN provide a positive development of SK's conception of the role
  of objective knowledge in a good human life?

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    A competitor to the views of Spinoza and Hegel

  Does RN have some good ideas about the relationship between theology,
  philosophy, and science?
