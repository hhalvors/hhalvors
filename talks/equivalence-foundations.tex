\begin{frame}{The old consensus}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Early 20th century: Zermelo-Frankel set theory won the battle
    about the foundations of mathematics.
  \item Defeated competitors:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Logicism
    \item Finitism
    \item Intuitionism
    \item Type theory
    \end{itemize}
  \item Philosophers take set theory as background framework for their
    inquiries. \newline {\footnotesize See: \fullcite{lewis-worlds}}
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{New developments}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Category theory and topos theory have proved fruitful in
    various branches of pure mathematics (Grothendieck, Mac Lane,
    Lawvere)
  \item Martin-L{\"o}f type theory
  \item Computation
  \item Homotopy type theory (HoTT)
  \item Philosophical worries about set theory (structuralism, etc.)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}

  What got me (HH) worried about set-theoretic foundations is that it
  seems to have too much ``sand'' for use in the foundations of
  physics.

  \bigskip Isomorphic models can have different features qua sets:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $M\vDash \phi (a)$ but $N\vDash \neg \phi (a)$.
  \item $\{ \emptyset \}\in M$ but $\{ \emptyset \}\not\in N$.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item It would seem natural to replace ZF with an elementary topos
    $\2E$, thereby ignoring the (otiose?) universal membership
    relation.
  \item In a topos, $x=y$ has no meaning for $x:A$ and $y:B$, with
    $A\neq B$.
  \item Question: Can isomorphic $\2E$-models of $T$ have different
    properties? It's important to be clear here about what ``different
    properties'' means.
  \end{itemize}  

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Topos-theoretic foundations are (apparently) more
    general. E.g.\ the axioms of synthetic differential geometry have
    no model in Sets, but do have a model in a topos.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Is a new battle coming?}

\begin{itemize}  
\item Feferman \citeyearpar{feferman1969,feferman1977} argues against
  category-theoretic foundations for philosophical reasons: the idea
  of ``aggregating'' is presupposed even in category theory.
\item The idea that Sets and Cats are incommensurable foundations was
  challenged via results of Mitchell, Osius, and Mathias
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What exactly did they prove?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Goals of this project}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluate Awodey's \citeyearpar{awodey} claim that Sets, Cats,
    and Types are equivalent foundations.\footnote{\citet{linnebo}
      also suggest that Sets and Types are equivalent foundations, but
      don't suggest any kind of formal proof.}
  \item Evaluate whether \citet{shulman} has established that ZFC and
    ETCS+R are bi-interpretable.
  \item Sharpen the definition of bi-interpretability and compare it
    to other notions of equivalence.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Equivalence and syntactic categories}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Morita equivalence \citep{morita} is an attempt to give an
    elementary expression of the idea that $\mathrm{Sh}(C_T)$ and
    $\mathrm{Sh}(C_{T'})$ are equivalent toposes
    \citep[see][]{makkai2006}.
  \item Morita equivalence is very likely (perhaps some fine-tuning
    needed?) the same thing as bi-interpretability
    \citep[see][]{halvorson}.
  \item Note: Morita equivalence is weaker (more liberal) than the
    notion that $C_T$ and $C_{T'}$ are equivalent categories.

\begin{frame}{Translation}

  The notion of \textbf{translation} is still a work in
  progress\footnote{The first explicit definition of a translation
    with arity $n\geq 1$ seems to be \citep{szczerba}. The idea is
    developed further in \citep{benthem,visser2006}. For an attempt to
    systematize, see \citep{halvorson}.} --- although it seems to be
  implicit in much of the standard literature.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A translation $F$ has an arity $n_F$, which says how many
    variables to split a single variable into.
  \item A translation $F$ has a domain formulas $\delta ^F_\sigma$ in
    the target language.
  \item A translation represents equality $=$ in $\Sigma$ in terms of
    some $T'$-provable equivalence relation in $\Sigma '$.
  \end{itemize}



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{$2$-cells between translations}

 \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (A) at (0,0) {$T$};
  \node (B) at (3,0) {$T'$};

  \draw[->] (A) to[bend left=30] node[above] {$F$} (B);
  \draw[->] (A) to[bend right=30] node[below] {$G$} (B);

  \draw[->, double] (1.5,0.4) -- (1.5,-0.4) node[midway, right] {$\chi$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Roughly speaking: A $2$-cell $\chi :F\Rightarrow G$ is a formula in
$\Sigma '$ that represents a functional relation from the domain
formula of $F$ to the domain formula of $G$ and that maps the
extension of $F(R)$ to the extension of $G(R)$, for each relation
symbol $R$ of $\Sigma$.\footnote{This idea is implicit throughout
  model theory, and is more explicit in \citep{visser2006}.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

  \begin{block}{Definition} Let $F:T\to T'$ and $G:T'\to T$ be
    translations. We say that $F$ and $G$ form an \textbf{equivalence}
    just in case there are invertible 2-cells
    $\eta :1_T\Rightarrow GF$ and $\varepsilon :1_{T'}\Rightarrow FG$.
  \end{block}  



\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

  A translation $F:T\to T'$ determines a functor
  $F^*:\mathrm{Mod}(T')\to\mathrm{Mod}(T)$. See
  \citep{gajda,halvorson}

  \vfill In particular, $F^*(M)$ is $n_F$ copies of $D(M)$, quotiented
  by the equivalence relation $=_F$.
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

  To be checked: a 2-cell $\chi :F\Rightarrow G$ should determine a
  natural transformation $\chi ^*:F^*\Rightarrow G^*$.

  \bigskip Note: $\chi ^*$ is not just any natural transformation, but
  is induced uniformly via a $\Sigma '$-formula that is a
  $T'$-provable functional relation.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Proving equivalence semantically}

  Given functors $f:\mathrm{Mod}(T')\to\mathrm{Mod}(T)$ and

\begin{frame}{Shulman's Theorem}



  \citet{shulman} seems very close to proving bi-interpretability of
  ZF and ETCS.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item For each model $U$ of ZF, there is a corresponding model of
    ETCS; and for each model $\2E$ of ETCS, there is a corresponding
    model of ZF.
  \item What are the permitted constructions?
  \item In what sense is the construction uniform, i.e.\ doesn't
    depend on specific features of a model?
  \item What needs to be shown about the constructions?

\begin{frame}{From universe to topos}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Given a model $\langle U,\in \rangle$ of ZF, let
    $\mathcal{E}_0=U$, and let $\mathcal{E}_1$ be the set of functions
    between sets (constructed as subsets of ordered pairs).
  \item Fact: the pair $\mathcal{E}_0,\mathcal{E}_1$ forms a model of
    ETCS.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The empty set is an initial object.

[FOM] Bi-interpretability vs mutual interpretability

Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]
Thomas Forster has asked me to elaborate on my previous posting in
relation to interpretability, hence the change of the subject line to
the present one.

Before I start, let me provide the URL of the Friedman article on
interpretations that I mentioned in my last posting:

http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~friedman/pdf/Tarski1,052407.pdf

The notions of interpretability and bi-interpretability between two
theories S and T are purely syntactic, but thanks to the completeness
theorem, they can be recast in model-theoretic terms as follows.

S is interpretable in T, via some interpretation I, if there is a
uniform way - via appropriate first order formulas, that's where the I
comes in by specifying exactly which formulas - of defining a model
I(M) of S for every model M of T.  The equality relation on I(M) is
allowed to be an equivalence (congruence) relation by the way.

S is said to be *bi-interpretable* with T if there is an
interpretation I of S in T, and an interpretation J of T in S, such
that S and T "invert" each other in the following sense:

(1) There is a uniform [definable] isomorphism between any model M of
T, and the model J(I(M)).
(2) There is a uniform [definable] isomorphism between any model M of
S, and the model I(J(M)).


ZF and ZFC are mutually interpretable [for the nontrivial direction
one can use either L [the constructible universe] or HOD [hereditarily
ordinal definable sets]. To see that ZF and ZFC are, in contrast, not
bi-interpretable, one can proceed as follows [there are other ways of
proving this].

(A) If S and T are bi-interpretable, then the automorphism groups
arising as Aut(M) for some model M of S must coincide with the
automorphism groups arising as Aut(M) for some model M of T.

(B) No model of ZFC has an automorphism f of order 2 since an
automorphism of finite order must fix the ordinals of the model, and
in the presence of AC, each set X of the model must also be fixed by f
since X is constructible from a subset of S ordinals in the sense of
the model [the latter result is well-known but not entirely trivial].

(C) By a theorem of Cohen, there is a model of ZF that has an
automorphism of order 2. Note that such a model cannot be well-founded
since well-founded models of the extensionality axiom are rigid.
Cohen's result is established by forcing over a nonstandard model of
ZF. The forcing machinery, contrary to the impression given by popular
expositions, can be recast as an entirely syntactic construction that
works for all models of set theory, even the nonstandard ones. This
was already very clear to Cohen, who remarked in his famous book on
the subject that independence results obtained by forcing, such as
"Con(ZF) implies Con(ZF+ not AC)", can be verified in PRA [primitive
recursive arithmetic], let alone PA.
